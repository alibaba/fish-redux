/// This document describes the core concepts under the Redux system and their standard definitions.
/// Mainly includes:
/// 1. The concepts of ReduxJs community
///    Action          ---- Definition of intention by plain object
///    Reducer<T>      ---- How to modify the data by a pure function
///    Dispatch        ---- Expression of intention
///    Middleware<T>   ---- AOP
///    Store<T>        ---- State management center
/// 2. Additional abstractions beyond the basic concepts of the ReduxJs community.
///    Connector<S, P> ---- The connection between big object <T> and small object <P>
///    Cloneable       ---- Clone an object
///    SubReducer<T>   ---- A function that modifies data of partial <T>
///    The role of this layer of abstraction
///    a. It is obvious that the implementation of combineReducers are decoupled with the grammatical features of JS
///    b. The deeper is the contradiction between the centralization of Redux and the division of components can be solved.

/// Action is a way of defining "intention".
///     1. It emphasizes the clarity of an intention, not the implementation of the intent.
///     2. Usually the implementation of the intent is done by Effect or Reducer.
///     3. type: indicates the type of intent; payload: the original information loaded with the intent.
///     4. Action definitions and standards, strictly follow the definition and standards of Action in the Redux community.
